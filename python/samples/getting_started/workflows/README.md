# Workflows Getting Started Samples

## Installation

Microsoft Agent Framework Workflows support ships with the core `agent-framework` or `agent-framework-core` package, so no extra installation step is required.

To install with visualization support:

```bash
pip install agent-framework[viz] --pre
```

To export visualization images you also need to [install GraphViz](https://graphviz.org/download/).

## Samples Overview

## Foundational Concepts - Start Here

Begin with the `_start-here` folder in order. These three samples introduce the core ideas of executors, edges, agents in workflows, and streaming.

| Sample | File | Concepts |
|--------|------|----------|
| Executors and Edges | [_start-here/step1_executors_and_edges.py](./_start-here/step1_executors_and_edges.py) | Minimal workflow with basic executors and edges |
| Agents in a Workflow | [_start-here/step2_agents_in_a_workflow.py](./_start-here/step2_agents_in_a_workflow.py) | Introduces adding Agents as nodes; calling agents inside a workflow |
| Streaming (Basics) | [_start-here/step3_streaming.py](./_start-here/step3_streaming.py) | Extends workflows with event streaming |

Once comfortable with these, explore the rest of the samples below.

| Tracing (Basics) | [observability/tracing_basics.py](./observability/tracing_basics.py) | Use basic tracing for workflow telemetry. Refer to this [directory](../observability/) to learn more about observability concepts. |

### orchestration

| Sample | File | Concepts |
|---|---|---|
| Concurrent Orchestration (Default Aggregator) | [orchestration/concurrent_agents.py](./orchestration/concurrent_agents.py) | Fan-out to multiple agents; fan-in with default aggregator returning combined ChatMessages |
| Concurrent Orchestration (Custom Aggregator) | [orchestration/concurrent_custom_aggregator.py](./orchestration/concurrent_custom_aggregator.py) | Override aggregator via callback; summarize results with an LLM |
| Concurrent Orchestration (Custom Agent Executors) | [orchestration/concurrent_custom_agent_executors.py](./orchestration/concurrent_custom_agent_executors.py) | Child executors own ChatAgents; concurrent fan-out/fan-in via ConcurrentBuilder |

| Sequential Orchestration (Custom Executor) | [orchestration/sequential_custom_executors.py](./orchestration/sequential_custom_executors.py) | Mix agents with a summarizer that appends a compact summary |

**Magentic checkpointing tip**: Treat `MagenticBuilder.participants` keys as stable identifiers. When resuming from a checkpoint, the rebuilt workflow must reuse the same participant names; otherwise the checkpoint cannot be applied and the run will fail fast.

### parallelism

| Sample | File | Concepts |
|---|---|---|
| Concurrent (Fan-out/Fan-in) | [parallelism/fan_out_fan_in_edges.py](./parallelism/fan_out_fan_in_edges.py) | Dispatch to multiple executors and aggregate results |
| Aggregate Results of Different Types | [parallelism/aggregate_results_of_different_types.py](./parallelism/aggregate_results_of_different_types.py) | Handle results of different types from multiple concurrent executors |

### state-management

| Sample | File | Concepts |
|---|---|---|
| Shared States | [state-management/shared_states_with_agents.py](./state-management/shared_states_with_agents.py) | Store in shared state once and later reuse across agents |

### visualization

| Sample | File | Concepts |
|---|---|---|
| Concurrent with Visualization | [visualization/concurrent_with_visualization.py](./visualization/concurrent_with_visualization.py) | Fan-out/fan-in workflow with diagram export |

### resources

- Sample text inputs used by certain workflows:
  - [resources/long_text.txt](./resources/long_text.txt)
  - [resources/email.txt](./resources/email.txt)
  - [resources/spam.txt](./resources/spam.txt)
  - [resources/ambiguous_email.txt](./resources/ambiguous_email.txt)

Notes

- Agent-based samples use provider SDKs (Azure/OpenAI, etc.). Ensure credentials are configured, or adapt agents accordingly.

Sequential orchestration uses a few small adapter nodes for plumbing:

- "input-conversation" normalizes input to `list[ChatMessage]`
- "to-conversation:<participant>" converts agent responses into the shared conversation
- "complete" publishes the final `WorkflowOutputEvent`
These may appear in event streams (ExecutorInvoke/Completed). They’re analogous to
concurrent’s dispatcher and aggregator and can be ignored if you only care about agent activity.

### Environment Variables

- **AzureOpenAIChatClient**: Set Azure OpenAI environment variables as documented [here](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/blob/main/python/samples/getting_started/chat_client/README.md#environment-variables).
  These variables are required for samples that construct `AzureOpenAIChatClient`

- **OpenAI** (used in orchestration samples):
  - [OpenAIChatClient env vars](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/blob/main/python/samples/getting_started/agents/openai_chat_client/README.md)
  - [OpenAIResponsesClient env vars](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/blob/main/python/samples/getting_started/agents/openai_responses_client/README.md)
