Expected Output:
============================================================
Step 1: Call divide(10, 0) - tool raises exception
    Tool failed: with error: division by zero
Response: Division by zero is undefined in standard arithmetic, so 10 ÷ 0 has no meaning.

If you’re curious about limits: as x approaches 0 from the positive side, 10/x tends to +∞; from the negative side,
10/x tends to -∞.

If you want a finite result, try dividing by a nonzero number, e.g., 10 ÷ 2 = 5 or 10 ÷ 0.1 = 100. Want me to compute
something else?
============================================================
Step 2: Call greet('Bob') - conversation can keep going.
Response: Hello, Bob!
