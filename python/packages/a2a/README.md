# Get Started with Microsoft Agent Framework A2A

Please install this package via pip:

pip install agent-framework-a2a --pre
```

## A2A Agent Integration

The A2A agent integration enables communication with remote A2A-compliant agents using the standardized A2A protocol. This allows your Agent Framework applications to connect to agents running on different platforms, languages, or services.

### Basic Usage Example

See the [A2A agent examples](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/tree/main/python/samples/getting_started/agents/a2a/) which demonstrate:

- Connecting to remote A2A agents
- Sending messages and receiving responses
- Handling different content types (text, files, data)
- Streaming responses and real-time interaction
