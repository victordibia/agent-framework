class WorkflowExecutor(Executor):
    """An executor that wraps a workflow to enable hierarchical workflow composition.

    ## Overview
    WorkflowExecutor makes a workflow behave as a single executor within a parent workflow,
    enabling nested workflow architectures. It handles the complete lifecycle of sub-workflow
    execution including event processing, output forwarding, and request/response coordination
    between parent and child workflows.

    ## Execution Model
    When invoked, WorkflowExecutor:
    1. Starts the wrapped workflow with the input message
    2. Runs the sub-workflow to completion or until it needs external input
    3. Processes the sub-workflow's complete event stream after execution
    4. Forwards outputs to the parent workflow's event stream
    5. Handles external requests by routing them to the parent workflow
    6. Accumulates responses and resumes sub-workflow execution

    ## Event Stream Processing
    WorkflowExecutor processes events after sub-workflow completion:

    ### Output Forwarding
    All outputs from the sub-workflow are automatically forwarded to the parent:

    .. code-block:: python

        # Sub-workflow yields outputs
        await ctx.yield_output("sub-workflow result")

        # WorkflowExecutor forwards to parent via ctx.send_message()
        # Parent receives the output as a regular message

    ### Request/Response Coordination
    When sub-workflows need external information:

    .. code-block:: python

        # Sub-workflow makes request
        request = MyDataRequest(query="user info")
        # RequestInfoExecutor emits RequestInfoEvent

        # WorkflowExecutor sets source_executor_id and forwards to parent
        request.source_executor_id = "child_workflow_executor_id"
        # Parent workflow can handle via @handler for RequestInfoMessage subclasses,
        # or directly forward to external source via a RequestInfoExecutor in the parent
        # workflow.

    ### State Management
    WorkflowExecutor maintains execution state across request/response cycles:
    - Tracks pending requests by request_id
    - Accumulates responses until all expected responses are received
    - Resumes sub-workflow execution with complete response batch
    - Handles concurrent executions and multiple pending requests

    ## Type System Integration
    WorkflowExecutor inherits its type signature from the wrapped workflow:

    ### Input Types
    Matches the wrapped workflow's start executor input types:

    .. code-block:: python

        # If sub-workflow accepts str, WorkflowExecutor accepts str
        workflow_executor = WorkflowExecutor(my_workflow, id="wrapper")
        assert workflow_executor.input_types == my_workflow.input_types

    ### Output Types
    Combines sub-workflow outputs with request coordination types:

    .. code-block:: python

        # Includes all sub-workflow output types
        # Plus RequestInfoMessage if sub-workflow can make requests
    output_types = workflow.output_types + [RequestInfoMessage]  # if applicable
    ```

    ## Error Handling
    WorkflowExecutor propagates sub-workflow failures:
    - Captures WorkflowFailedEvent from sub-workflow
    - Converts to WorkflowErrorEvent in parent context
    - Provides detailed error information including sub-workflow ID

    ## Concurrent Execution Support
    WorkflowExecutor fully supports multiple concurrent sub-workflow executions:

    ### Per-Execution State Isolation
    Each sub-workflow invocation creates an isolated ExecutionContext:

    .. code-block:: python

        # Multiple concurrent invocations are supported
        workflow_executor = WorkflowExecutor(my_workflow, id="concurrent_executor")

        # Each invocation gets its own execution context
        # Execution 1: processes input_1 independently
        # Execution 2: processes input_2 independently
        # No state interference between executions

    ### Request/Response Coordination
    Responses are correctly routed to the originating execution:
    - Each execution tracks its own pending requests and expected responses
    - Request-to-execution mapping ensures responses reach the correct sub-workflow
    - Response accumulation is isolated per execution
    - Automatic cleanup when execution completes

    ### Memory Management
    - Unlimited concurrent executions supported
    - Each execution has unique UUID-based identification
    - Cleanup of completed execution contexts
    - Thread-safe state management for concurrent access

    ### Important Considerations
    **Shared Workflow Instance**: All concurrent executions use the same underlying workflow instance.
    For proper isolation, ensure that:
    - The wrapped workflow and its executors are stateless
    - Executors use WorkflowContext state management instead of instance variables
    - Any shared state is managed through WorkflowContext.get_shared_state/set_shared_state

    .. code-block:: python

        # Good: Stateless executor using context state
        class StatelessExecutor(Executor):
            @handler
            async def process(self, data: str, ctx: WorkflowContext[str]) -> None:
                # Use context state instead of instance variables
                state = await ctx.get_state() or {}
                state["processed"] = data
                await ctx.set_state(state)


        # Avoid: Stateful executor with instance variables
        class StatefulExecutor(Executor):
            def __init__(self):
                super().__init__(id="stateful")
                self.data = []  # This will be shared across concurrent executions!

    ## Integration with Parent Workflows
    Parent workflows can intercept sub-workflow requests:
    ```python
    class ParentExecutor(Executor):
        @handler
        async def handle_request(
            self,
            request: MyRequestType,  # Subclass of RequestInfoMessage
            ctx: WorkflowContext[RequestResponse[RequestInfoMessage, Any] | RequestInfoMessage],
        ) -> None:
            # Handle request locally or forward to external source
            if self.can_handle_locally(request):
                # Send response back to sub-workflow
                response = RequestResponse(data="local result", original_request=request, request_id=request.request_id)
                await ctx.send_message(response, target_id=request.source_executor_id)
            else:
                # Forward to external handler
                await ctx.send_message(request)
    ```

    ## Implementation Notes
    - Sub-workflows run to completion before processing their results
    - Event processing is atomic - all outputs are forwarded before requests
    - Response accumulation ensures sub-workflows receive complete response batches
    - Execution state is maintained for proper resumption after external requests
    - Concurrent executions are fully isolated and do not interfere with each other
